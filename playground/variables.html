  // Scoping in JavaScript answers the question "Where are my variables available to me?"

  // function scoped variables; only available within the parent function
  var first = 'Elie';
  // block scoped variables; introduced as part of ES6
  let age = 37;
  const cool = true;

  // - Use const by default; when declaring a new variable, just default it to
  //   const since we don't know if we'll need to update its value or not.
  // - Use let if we need to change the value of the variable.
  // - Avoid using var. There are some exceptions like when declaring a variable
  //   outside a block
