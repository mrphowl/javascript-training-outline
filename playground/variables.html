   * Naming conventions

   * - As a convention, variables should not start with a capital unless
   *   they are a class.
   * - Variables must start with either a letter (a,b,c,D,X, etc).
   * - They can also start with or contain an underscore _ or dollar sign $.
   * - They can also contain but may not start with a number.
